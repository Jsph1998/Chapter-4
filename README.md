# Chapter-4
In this chapter, i learned how to create the starter project I'll use
for all future apps in this book. I created folder with mkdir command 
and named them accordingly to group logic. I also created two Dart files:
main.dart for the main() function that starts the app and home.dart to contain 
the code for the home widget.
